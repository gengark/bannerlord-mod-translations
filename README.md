## 📖 Introduction

This repository is to better manage the translation versions of the mod, and allow players other than the publishers to
correct or inherit them.

Most of the translation files were automatically generated
by [bannerlord-helper](https://github.com/gengark/bannerlord-helper), and have been manually proofread.

> [!TIP]
>
> You are authorized to modify any incorrect translations and publish these files in any community.
